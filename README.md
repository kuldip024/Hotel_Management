# Hotel_Management

Engineered a dynamic Hotel Management System using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Figma. This project seamlessly integrates user-friendly design with robust functionality, showcasing my proficiency in full-stack development and UI/UX design. By delivering solutions that enhance user experiences and streamline operations, I also developed an intuitive Admin panel to further improve system efficiency.
